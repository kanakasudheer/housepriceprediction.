1. pandas

What it is: pandas is a powerful and widely used Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are efficient for handling and processing structured data.

Key Features:

Data loading and reading from various file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation (filtering, sorting, grouping, etc.).
Handling missing data.
Data aggregation and summarization.
Time series analysis.
Integration with other data science libraries like scikit-learn and matplotlib.
How it's used in your code: You're using pandas to read the Housing dataset from a CSV file (pd.read_csv), perform data exploration (df.info(), df.describe()), and prepare the data for machine learning.

2. scikit-learn (sklearn)

What it is: scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library in Python. It provides tools for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

Key Features:

Wide range of machine learning algorithms.
Model evaluation metrics.
Data preprocessing techniques (scaling, encoding, etc.).
Model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
Pipeline functionalities for building complex workflows.
How it's used in your code: You're using scikit-learn for data preprocessing (StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder), splitting data into training and testing sets (train_test_split), creating and training a linear regression model (LinearRegression), and evaluating model performance (mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score).

3. matplotlib

What it is: matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It provides a wide variety of plot types and customization options.

Key Features:

Line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and more.
Customization of plot elements (colors, labels, titles, legends, etc.).
Saving plots to different file formats (PNG, JPG, PDF, etc.).
Integration with other libraries like pandas and NumPy.
How it's used in your code: You're using matplotlib to create box plots to visualize the distribution of numerical features and identify outliers (plt.boxplot), and to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between area and price (plt.scatter). Additionally, you use it to display the plots using plt.show().
